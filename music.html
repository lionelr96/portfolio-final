				<h2>What exactly is African American Music?</h2>
				<p>
					African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of music and musical genres
					largely developed
					by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition
					of slavery
					that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War
				</p>
				<p>
					White slave owners sought to completely subjugate their slaves physically, mentally, and spiritually
					through
					brutality and demeaning acts. African-Americans used music to counter this dehumanization. White
					Americans
					considered African-Americans separate and unequal for centuries, going to extraordinary lengths to
					keep blacks
					oppressed. African-Americans created a distinctive music that sank its roots deeply into their
					experience
				</p>
				<p>
					The earliest jazz and blues recordings were made in the 1920s. African-American musicians developed
					related styles
					such as rhythm and blues in the 1940s. In the 1960s, soul performers had a major influence on white
					US and UK
					singers. In the mid-1960s, Black musicians developed funk and they were many of the leading figures
					in late 1960s
					and 1970s genre of jazz-rock fusion. In the 1970s and 1980s, Black artists developed hip-hop, and in
					the 1980s
					introduced the disco-infused dance style known as house music. Much of today's genres of music is
					heavily
					influenced by traditional African-American music
