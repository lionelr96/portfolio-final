			<h2>African American Fashion comes in many forms, from attire and even hair</h2>

					<h3>Attire</h3>
					<p>
						The Black Arts Movement, a cultural explosion of the 1960s, saw the incorporation of surviving
						cultural dress with
						elements from modern fashion and West African traditional clothing to create a uniquely
						African-American
						traditional style. Kente cloth is the best known African textile. These colorful woven patterns,
						which exist in
						numerous varieties, were originally made by the Ashanti and Ewe peoples of Ghana and Togo. Kente
						fabric also
						appears in a number of Western style fashions ranging from casual T-shirts to formal bow ties
						and
						cummerbunds.
						Kente strips are often sewn into liturgical and academic robes or worn as stoles. Since the
						Black
						Arts Movement,
						traditional African clothing has been popular amongst African Americans for both formal and
						informal
						occasions.
						Other manifestations of traditional African dress in common evidence in African-American culture
						are
						vibrant
						colors, mud cloth, trade beads and the use of Adinkra motifs in jewelry and in couture and
						decorator
						fabrics
					</p>
					<p>
						Another common aspect of fashion in African-American culture involves the appropriate dress for
						worship in the
						Black church. It is expected in most churches that an individual present their best appearance
						for
						worship.
						African-American women in particular are known for wearing vibrant dresses and suits. An
						interpretation of a
						passage from the Christian Bible, "...every woman who prays or prophesies with her head
						uncovered
						dishonors her
						head...", has led to the tradition of wearing elaborate Sunday hats, sometimes known as "crowns
					</p>
					<p>
						Hip hop fashion is popular with African Americans. Grillz were made popular by African American
						rapper Nelly.
						Sagging pants was a part of African American culture. Air Jordan, a shoe brand that's named
						after
						former
						African American basketball player Michael Jordan is very popular among the African-American
						community
					</p>

					<h3>Hair</h3>
					<p>YES! Hair</p>
					<p>
						Hair styling in African-American culture is greatly varied. African-American hair is typically
						composed of coiled
						curls, which range from tight to wavy. Many women choose to wear their hair in its natural
						state.
						Natural hair can
						be styled in a variety of ways, including the afro, twist outs, braid outs, and wash and go
						styles.
						It is a myth
						that natural hair presents styling problems or is hard to manage; this myth seems prevalent
						because
						mainstream
						culture has, for decades, attempted to get African-American women to conform to its standard of
						beauty (i.e.,
						straight hair). To that end, some women prefer straightening of the hair through the application
						of
						heat or
						chemical processes.[79] Although this can be a matter of personal preference, the choice is
						often
						affected by
						straight hair being a beauty standard in the West and the fact that hair type can affect
						employment.
						However, more
						and more women are wearing their hair in its natural state and receiving positive feedback.
						Alternatively, the
						predominant and most socially acceptable practice for men is to leave one's hair natural
					</p>
					<p>
						Often, as men age and begin to lose their hair, the hair is either closely cropped, or the head
						is
						shaved
						completely free of hair. However, since the 1960s, natural hairstyles, such as the afro, braids,
						waves, fades, and
						dreadlocks, have been growing in popularity. Despite their association with radical political
						movements and their
						vast difference from mainstream Western hairstyles, the styles have attained considerable, but
						certainly limited,
						social acceptance
					</p>
					<p>
						Maintaining facial hair is more prevalent among African-American men than in other male
						populations
						in the US.[83]
						In fact, the soul patch is so named because African-American men, particularly jazz musicians,
						popularized the
						style.[84] The preference for facial hair among African-American men is due partly to personal
						taste, but also
						because they are more prone than other ethnic groups to develop a condition known as
						pseudofolliculitis barbae,
						commonly referred to as razor bumps, many prefer not to shave

								An afro is a natural growth of curly textured hair, in any length kinky hair texture
								(also known as a
								natural), or specifically styled with chemical curling products by individuals with
								naturally curly or
								straight hair. The hairstyle can be created by combing the hair away from the scalp,
								dispersing a
								distinctive curl pattern, and forming the hair into a rounded shape, much like a cloud
								or puff ball.</p>

							<p>
								Cornrows or canerows are a style of hair braiding in which the hair is braided very
								close to the scalp, using
								an underhand, upward motion to make a continuous, raised row. Cornrows are often done in
								simple, straight lines,
								as the term implies, but they can also be styled in elaborate geometric or curvilinear
								designs

								The Jheri curl (often spelled Jerry curl or Jeri Curl) is a permanent wave hairstyle

								Redding, the Jheri curl
								gives the wearer a glossy, loosely curled look. It was touted as a "wash and wear" style
								that was easier to care
								for than the other popular chemical treatment of the day, the relaxer
